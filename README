== Topspin Flash Widget API, Source Code, Examples ==
The Flash Widget API can be used to create custom widgets using the widget data 
created in the Topspin platform.  The API abstracts data event logging from the 
development so that focus can be placed on building advanced custom widgets
while still reporting valuable widget metrics to the Topspin client. 

Currently, there are three types of widgets that this TSAPI supports, 
source code for each of the widget soon to be added:

    * Streaming Player
    * Single Track Player
    * Email For Media 

In addition to the API, source code to in house Topspin widgets will be made
available and may be repurposed for your needs, these widgets will live in the
folder, TSWidgets.     

As a convenience, the folder, Thirdparty, includes the following AS3 packages which 
are used in the widgets for tweening, Google analytics, JSON, Twitter api, and misc utilities.  
    * GreenSock TweenLite : http://www.greensock.com/tweenlite/
    * Adobe core lib : http://code.google.com/p/as3corelib/
    * Twitter API for Flash : http://blog.twitter.com/2006/10/twitter-api-for-flash-developers.html
    * Google Analytics : analytics.swc

== Requirements ==
    * Flash compiler such as:  Adobe Flex Builder, Flash Builder, Flash CS4, FDT


== Installation ==
In general to create a Topspin widget, the only package that is required is the
TSAPI folder which contain the api package:  com.topspin.api

Download the folder and contents and add the package to you classpath when compiling
your widgets.  More information and documentation can be found in the Topspin
